# Weather-School

This repository contains source for [weatherschool.aaas.org](http://weatherschool.aaas.org/), a project for which I managed/did curriculum development and front-end design in the final year of the grant.

Weather-school is an educational resource to teach middle-school students about weather patterns by the team at AAAS's [Project2061](http://project2061.aaas.org). It includes nifty integration of Google Maps and decades of NOAA weather data to look at trends in weather across the planet over time.
