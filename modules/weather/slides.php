	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<div class="intro-text">	
	<p>Weatherschool@AAAS introduces you to a variety of factors that affect patterns in air temperature. In a series of modules, you will learn how moving air masses can cause day-to-day temperature variation, how geographic factors such as elevation above sea level can influence temperature at any given location, and how the movement of the earth in relation to the sun can affect temperature over the course of a year. The modules use Google Maps to interact with daily measurements collected by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The data were collected by local weather stations between 1929 and 2010 in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>
Each module begins with a guided activity designed to illustrate a temperature pattern or a variable affecting that pattern. This is followed by an open-ended <b>Try It</b> activity. In the <b>Try It</b> activity, you can further explore the featured pattern by picking different locations on the maps and choosing different dates.</p>
<p>
At the end of each module you can check your understanding by answering the <b>Quiz Yourself</b> questions or learn more by following the <b>Expand Your Knowledge</b> links.</p>

				<p>The graph above shows how average daily temperature in Washington DC changed between January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2003.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>What do you notice? Does the graph have a pattern? How often does the pattern repeat? </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>You should see that the temperature rises and falls consistently throughout each year. But is the pattern always exactly the same? Hover over the line on the graph and find the high and low temperatures each year. If you would like to see a section of the graph in more detail, just use your cursor to drag a box around it. You can always zoom back out by clicking on Reset View at the top right side of the graph.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>In some years, the coldest day may be in December. In others, it may be in January. The warmest day is usually in July or August. Note that the high and low temperatures vary from year to year as well. The warmest day in 2002 was warmer than the warmest day in either 2000 or 2001. While the pattern is similar from year to year, it is clearly not identical.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<p>Another way to think about annual temperature variation is by looking at the line on the graph. Does the line increase smoothly from the lowest temperature to the highest temperature of each year? Is the shape of the line the same from year to year?</p>
			</div>
				
			<div>
				<p>The line is jagged because temperature varies from day to day. Because of daily temperature variation, not every July 1st is going to have the same temperature and not every July 2nd is going to have the same temperature.</p>
			</div>
		
			<div>
				<p>You will now have a chance to observe annual temperature patterns at locations and dates of your choosing. See if other locations in the United States have annual temperature patterns of warmer summers and cooler winters.

	<h2>Large Bodies of Water and Temperature</h2>
	<div class="intro-text">	
	<p>In the previous modules, you saw that the temperature at a place is related to how far the place is from the tropical zone (its latitude) and that temperature at a place is related to how far the place is above sea level (its elevation). The greater the latitude (farther from the tropical zone), the colder the place is, and the higher the elevation of a place, the colder the place is. This assumes, of course, that all other factors are kept constant. Obviously a place in the Rocky Mountains in the summer could be warmer than a place in New York City in the winter.</p>
	<p>
	In this module, you are going to find out whether the temperature at a place is related to how close the place is to a large body of water.</p>

				<p>Are temperature and how close a place is to a body of water related? This activity looks at temperatures at two locations that are different distances from a large body of water to find out.</p>
			</div>
			<div>	
				<p>In this activity you will explore the temperature patterns in Tromso, which is on the coast of the Norwegian Sea and is one of the northernmost cities on earth (pictured in the module introduction). You will also explore temperature patterns in Kautokeino, a small village about 125 miles southeast of Tromso.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
			<p>Zoom two or three clicks to get a closer look.The yellow dots represent the 20 reporting stations closest to the marker. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
			<p>Click on the reporting stations labeled Tromso and Kautokeino. Tromso is northwest of the marker and Kautokeino is southeast.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>The graph shows the average daily temperatures in Tromso and in Kautokeino from January 1, 2004 to Dec. 31, 2004.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>The graph shows that in the winter and early spring in Kautokeino, which is farther from the water, the average temperature is quite a bit colder than in Tromso, which is closer to the water. In the summer, Tromso is a little cooler than Kautokeino.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>You should also notice that the line on the graph for Tromso, the place that is closer to the water, is flatter than the line for Kautokeino, the place that is farther from the water.</p> 
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>In other words, there is a bigger range between high and low temperatures during the year in the place that is farther from the water. The high temperature is higher, and the low temperature is lower the farther a place is from a large body of water.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>The reason for these patterns is that the temperature of the water has an effect on the air around it. Because water heats up and cools down more slowly than land, the range in air temperature near large bodies of water throughout the year is smaller.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>You will now have a chance to observe the effect of proximity to a large body of water on temperature at locations of your choosing. See if other locations near a large body of water experience cooler summers and warmer winters compared to nearby locations farther inland.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<p>2. The 20 closest reporting stations appear as yellow dots around the location you chose. Zoom in to get a closer look at where the yellow dots are located. Choose one reporting station that is as close to the large body of water as possible. Choose a second reporting station that is farther inland. Click on both reporting stations to highlight them.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>3. Now click on the "Start" calendar to choose a starting date and the "End" calendar to choose an ending date. Pick dates at least one year apart. Then click the right arrow to continue.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>4. When you choose locations, make sure that they are at approximately the same elevation. If one of them is at a much higher elevation than the other one, it will be difficult to tell if the different patterns you see are due to elevation or how close the two places are to a large body of water. Coastal areas often have mountains nearby, so when comparing two locations make sure one of them is not in the mountains and the other at sea level. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Also note that you may have difficulty finding reporting stations that are very close to large bodies of water because there aren't many reporting stations right on the shoreline.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>You will also see that the closeness to a large body of water does not always have the same effect on temperature from place to place. At some places the effect is barely noticeable, and at other places it is very strong. This is because other factors, such as wind direction, can also have an effect on how much of the warmer or cooler air that is over the water gets inland.</p>

	<h2>Temperature</h2>
	<div class="scrollable">
	<p>You have now examined three factors that are related to the air temperature at a particular location: (1) how close a place is to the equator (latitude), (2) how far a place is above sea level (elevation), and (3) how close a place is to a large body of water.</p>
	<p>There is one other factor that has been mentioned, but it was not demonstrated in this module. That is whether or not a mass of cold or warm air has moved into a place to affect its temperature. You should know that as the wind blows, warmer or cooler air is constantly moving into and out of an area, which changes the temperature of the air at that place.</p>
	<p>To see how clouds and, therefore, air move across the United States, click on the following web links. The speed of cloud movement has been speeded up, but you can see from these videos that the air above us is always moving. Sometimes this means that warmer air is moving in from another location and sometimes colder air is moving into a region.</p>

			<div><p>The table above shows data from Chicago for 12 specific dates. For each date, the data you see in the "Average air temperature" and "Daily recorded energy from the sun" is averaged over a period of 10 years. Data in the other columns does not change from year to year.</p>

				<p>The place we have chosen is in Colombia in South America.</p>
			</div>
			<div><p>Notice how flat the line on the graph is? In late December there are just a little less than 12 hours of daylight, and in late June, there are just a little more than 12 hours of daylight. In late March (the first day of spring) and in late September (the  first day of fall), there are 12 hours of daylight, just as there are in New  York City.</p></div>
			<div>Another way to describe the difference in the number of hours of daylight at these different places is to say that the range of daylight hours is different from place to place. The annual range of daylight hours in Colombia, which is near the equator in South America, is very small; the range is quite a bit larger in New York City; and larger yet in Plattsburgh, NY.

	<p>In the last module you saw that the hours of daylight at a location changes over the course of the year in a way that is very similar to the pattern for changes in temperature and maximum height of the sun in the sky. You have also seen that there is a relationship between the maximum height of the sun in the sky and temperature. During the parts of the year when the sun is higher in the sky, it tends to be warmer.</p>

			<div>	<p>Are temperature and the number of hours of daylight at a given place related? In this activity you will look at average daily temperature and the number of hours of daylight for 12 different dates in Chicago, Illinois to find out.</p></div>
			<div>	<p>The map above pinpoints Chicago, IL. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
			The table above is the same one you used in Module G. It shows data from Chicago for 12 specific dates in the year 2000. </p></div>
			<div>	<p>Select columns in the table in the following order: click first on top of the "Hours of daylight" column to highlight it in red; then click on the top of the "Average air temperature" column to highlight it in blue. If you make a mistake and the colors are reversed, you can re-click to unselect and try again.</p></div>
			<div>	<p>Just as you saw in module G, the graph you see here is called a scatter plot. Each point represents a value for the two variables. It tells you what the average daily temperature is for a certain number of hours of daylight on that day.</p></div>
			<div>	<p>Click Line of Best Fit at the bottom right corner of the page.</p></div>
			<div>	<p>The line of best fit that you see going through the scatterplot represents the linear (straight-line) relationship between the two variables you selected in the table. It shows you how the number of hours of daylight and the average daily temperature are related.</p>
			</div>
			<div>	<p>You can see from this graph that during the time of the year when the days are longer the temperature tends to be warmer, and during the time of year when the days are shorter, the temperature tends to be cooler. This makes sense because the longer the day, the more time there is for the earth and the air around the earth to absorb energy from the sun.</p></div>

	<p>You can use the Seasons Simulator on the next slide to show how the changing position of the earth with respect to the sun causes the angle that the sun's rays hit the earth to also change throughout the year. There are 3 separate, but related animations in the simulator:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The animation on the <b>left</b> shows how the earth's position relative to the sun changes throughout the year.</li>
		<li>The animation in the <b>upper right</b> shows where the sun's rays hit the earth on the particular day that is modeled between the earth and sun on the left.</li>
		<li>The animation on the <b>lower right</b> shows the angle that the suns rays hit the earth at the location of the stick figure in the upper right and on the same day modeled in the other two animations.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Instructions:</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Change the date</b> with the calendar at the bottom. Move the red marker to select the date depicted in all the animations.</li>
		<li><b>Change the location</b> by moving the stick figure in the upper right to change the latitude depicted in the lower right.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Use the Seasons Simulator to expand your knowledge of questions from modules F and G:</b></p>
	<p><b>Why does the maximum height of the sun in the sky changes throughout the year?</b><br>
	Place the stick figure at a latitude between 25 and 50 degrees latitude. Start the animation to change the date shown in the animations. Notice that the angle that the sun's rays hit the earth changes throughout the year. This angle corresponds to changing heights of the sun in the sky.</p>
	<p><b>Why is the height of the sun in the sky related to temperature?</b><br>
	Place the stick figure around 50 degrees north. Start the animation. Stop the animation in November or December. Notice that the sun's rays hit the earth at a very small angle and the distance between the rays is very large. When the height of the sun in the sky is very low, the intensity of the sun's rays hitting the earth is smaller. This causes less solar energy to reach the earth. Therefore, the air temperature is lower. </p>

	<h2>Relationships between variables</h2>
	<p>In  the previous set of activities, you saw how high, low, and average daily  temperature, hours of daylight, maximum height of the sun in the sky, and the  average amount of energy that a place receives from the sun change from day to  day over the course of a year.  You were  also able to compare those changes at different places. When you looked at  different places, you should have noticed that how far north or south of the topical  zone a place is affects its high, low, and average daily temperature, the  maximum height of the sun in the sky, and so on.</p>
	<p>In  the next set of activities, we are going to look more closely at the  relationships between these variables.   We want to find out how the different variables are related to each  other and how they affect the temperature at a place.</p>

		<li>Now  that you have seen how length of day, angle of the sun, and amount of solar  energy affect the temperature at a place and how all of those things change  over the course of year, we will now look at models of the earth-sun system  that will help to explain the patterns that we observe throughout the  year.   </li>

	<div class="scrollable">
	<ul>
		<li>First let&rsquo;s review some basic ideas about how  the earth and sun are related.</li>
		<li>A good way to start is by trying to make sense  of the model above.</li>
		<li>The first thing to remember is that the earth  moves around the sun. It makes one full trip around the sun in a year. It gets  a quarter of the way around in three months and half way around in six months.</li>
		<li>Another thing to keep in mind is that it stays  in the same plane as it moves around the sun, as if it were rolling along a  flat surface. It doesn&rsquo;t bounce up and down as it goes around the sun. </li>
		<li>When you look at the diagram, you can also see that  the axis of the earth (the line between the North and South Poles) is always  tilted. That tilt does not change throughout the year. This means that the  North Pole is always aimed toward the same point in space no matter where the  earth is in its path around the sun.</li>
		<li>The tilt of earth&rsquo;s axis is always 23.5o  away from the straight up and down line that you see in the diagram. If you  think of the plane of the earth&rsquo;s orbit as a table top, the straight up and  down line would be coming straight up from the top of the table. In other  words, that line would be perpendicular to the table top.</li>
		<li>The correct mathematical way to describe the  tilt of the earth is to say: The earth&rsquo;s axis of rotation is tilted 23.5o  from a line that is perpendicular to the plane of the earth&rsquo;s orbit around the  sun. Look carefully at the diagram to see if this statement makes sense to you.  First look at the plane of earth&rsquo;s orbit represented in the diagram as a dark  gray flat surface that the earth moves around the sun on. Then find the line  that is drawn perpendicular to that plane. Finally, note the way the earth is  tilted relative to that perpendicular line.</li>

		<li>As  the earth moves around the sun, different parts of the sun are pointed toward  or away from the sun at different times of the year.</li>
		<li>In  the diagram above, when it is summer in the northern hemisphere, the North Pole  is pointed toward the sun, but in the winter in the northern hemisphere, the South  Pole is pointed toward the sun.</li>
		<li>In  the spring and fall, the axis of rotation is pointed neither toward nor away  from the sun.  Whether the North or South  Pole is pointed away from the sun, toward the sun, or neither toward nor away  from the sun at different times of the year is why we have seasons.</li>

	<div class="scrollable">
	<ul>
		<li>One more thing to keep in mind is that the earth spins  on its axis once every 24 hours.  This is  the day night cycle. </li>
		<li>In the diagram above, imagine that the sun is far to  the right. The part of the earth that is facing the sun is in daylight, and the  part of the earth that is facing away from the sun is in darkness.</li>
		<li>As the earth spins on its axis, different places move  into and out of daylight.</li>
		<li>The sun rises in the east, gets higher and higher in  the sky until it reaches its maximum height in the middle of the day, then  starts to get lower and lower in the sky until it finally sets in the west late  in the day.</li>
		<li>As the sun gets higher in the sky, the amount of  energy that a place on earth gets from the sun increases, and the temperature  rises. As the sun gets lower in the sky, the amount of energy at that place  decreases, and the  temperature drops. </li>

	<ul>
		<li>Finally,  to complete the story of the geometry of the earth-sun system, we need to pay  attention to the fact that the earth is a sphere. </li>
		<li>Because  the earth is a sphere, the light from the sun strikes the earth at different  angles at different places.</li>
		<li>Look  at the spheres below. Notice that when you shine a light on a sphere, the part  of the sphere that is closest to the light source is illuminated most brightly.  This is the place where the light strikes the sphere at a 90 degree angle.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Notice  that there is only one place on the surface of the sphere where the sun strikes  the sphere at a 90 degree angle. At all other places, the light strikes at less  than a 90 degree angle. The farther away from the place where the light strikes  at a 90 degree angle, the smaller the angle of the light is. </li>
		<li>This  is also true on the surface of the earth. At any one time, there is only one  place where the sun strikes the earth at a 90 degree angle. The farther away  from that place a location is, the smaller the angle at which the sun strikes  the earth. At the North Pole, for example, the sun always strikes the earth at  a very low angle, and at some times of the year the sun is not visible at all.</li>

		<li>As you can see, earth-sun system is very complicated.  The earth is spinning at the same time it is orbiting around the earth, and  because the earth&rsquo;s axis is tilted, we see  the sun differently at different times of the year.</li>
		<li>To keep things simple, when we model this complex  system, we will not always show all the parts moving at the same time. This  will allow us to focus on one thing at a time.</li>
		<li>In the next set of activities, you will start out by  looking at a dynamic (moving) model of the earth-sun system with the parts in  motion, and then you will look at a number of static images of the same  system.  Altogether this should give you  a better understanding of the changes that take place throughout the year.</li>

			<div><p>Because  the North Pole is tilted 23.5 degrees toward the sun on the first day of  summer, 23.5o N latitude is the place where the sun strikes at a 90  degree angle.

First try to estimate the angle by looking at  the tilt of the arrows in the lower right hand side of the model above. If the  arrows are lying flat, the angle is zero degrees, and if arrows are pointed  straight up and down, the angle is 90 degrees.   If they are tilted but not straight up and down, then the angle is  somewhere between 0 and 90 degrees.
