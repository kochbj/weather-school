	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<div class="intro-text">	
	<p>This website introduces you to a variety of factors that affect patterns in air temperature. In a series of modules, you will learn how moving air masses can cause day-to-day temperature variation, how geographic factors such as elevation above sea level can influence air temperature at any given location, and how the movement of the earth in relation to the sun can affect air temperature over time. The modules use daily climate measurements collected by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The data were collected by local weather stations, both within the United States and around the world, from 1929 to 2010.</p>
<p>
Each module begins with a guided <b>Activity</b> to illustrate a pattern in air temperature or a variable affecting it. This is followed by an open-ended <b>Try It</b> section. In the <b>Try It</b> section, you can further explore the featured pattern by picking different locations in Google Maps and choosing your own dates.</p>
<p>
At the completion of each module you can check your understanding of the featured pattern by answering the <b>Quiz Yourself</b> questions. You can learn more about what causes the patterns by following the links in the <b>Expand Your Knowledge</b> section. Click the next arrow to begin a brief introduction to each module.</p>

	<p style="margin-left: 15px;">You have now seen that air temperature in a particular place can vary considerably from one day to the next. This variation is caused by the movement of large masses of warm and cool air.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 15px;">As the wind blows, warmer or cooler air is constantly moving into and out of an area, and this movement of air changes the temperature at that place.</p>

The cloud movement has been speeded up, but you can see from these videos that the air above us is always moving.

	<p>In the last module you saw that temperature can change considerably from one day to the next. In this module you will explore how temperature can change from day to day over the course of an entire year - from winter to spring to summer to fall - and from year to year. </p>

			<div>
				<p>First choose a location on the map by clicking on that location.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Now use the calendar to choose a year.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>What you see here is a graph of the average daily temperatures that were reported at [the selected location] for [the selected year].</p>
				<p>Temperature can be read on the y-axis (the vertical axis), and time of year can be read on the x-axis (the horizontal axis).</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>The temperature that you see reported for a given day is the average of the temperature measurements that were taken at that reporting station for that day. Some stations collect air temperature data every hour, and some collect air temperature data less often.  But however many measurements that were taken, the number you see is the <span class="tooltip" title="average is a mean of the measurements and that the mean is calculated by adding together all the measurements and dividing by the number of measurements.">average</span> of them for that date. You may see that there are some days when there were no data reported at that station, perhaps  because there was no one to record it or because the measuring equipment was not working.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Notice that the temperature rises and falls throughout the year.  You should also notice that the temperature goes up and down from day to day in a jagged way.  The curve is not perfectly smooth.  This is because even though there is an overall trend in how the temperature increases or decreases throughout the year, there is also variation in that pattern of increasing and decreasing from day to day.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<p>Next let's look more closely at this day-to-day variation.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>As you can see above, the first part of the graph has been highlighted. This allows you to zoom in and look at a smaller part of the curve more closely.</p>
				<p>When you want to zoom in, all you have to do is place your cursor at one corner of the rectangle that you want to look at, click and hold at that spot, and drag the cursor to cover the area you want to highlight. If you make a mistake, you can just click on “reset zoom” and try again.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<p>Now let's view the graph after we've zoomed in.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>In the image above, just the temperatures for days in January are included. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>By hovering over a date, you can see the average temperature reported for that day.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>You can also see how much change there is in the average temperature from day to day. Notice that in this example, on January 20, 2000, the average temperature for that day was 25.5o F.  But the day before, on January 19, the average temperature was 41.7 o F. That’s a big change in one day. The only thing that could cause that much change is cold air moving in from another location.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<p>Now you try it. Highlight just the month of January as shown on the previous page.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Move the cursor to see what the temperature is on the individual days.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Highlight other parts of the graph to observe day-to-day patterns.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Choose different locations and different times of the year to see how the temperature changes at those locations during the year.</p>

				<p>The graph above shows how average daily temperature in Washington DC changed between January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2003.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>What do you notice? Does the graph have a pattern? How often does the pattern repeat? </p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>You should see that the temperature rises and falls consistently throughout each year. But is it always the same? Hover over the line on the graph and find the high and low temperatures each year. If you would like to see a section of the graph in more detail, just drag a box around it. You can always zoom back out by hitting "Reset View".</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>In some years the coldest day falls in December. In others it falls in January. The warmest day can fall in July or August. Note that the actual temperature varies between these warmest days as well. The warmest day in 2002 is warmer than the warmest day in either 2000 or 2001. While the pattern is similar from year to year, it is clearly not identical.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<p>Another way to think about annual temperature variation is by looking at the line on the graph. Does the line increase smoothly from the lowest temperature to the highest temperature of each year? Is the shape of the line the same from year to year?</p>
			</div>
				
			<div>
				<p>The line is jagged because air temperature varies from day to day. Because of daily temperature variation, not every July 1st is going to have the same air temperature and not every July 2nd is going to have the same air temperature. If the difference in temperature from day to day is not always the same, then the annual temperature pattern will be different from year to year as well.</p>
			</div>
		
			<div>
				<p>You will now have a chance to observe annual temperature patterns at locations and dates of your choosing. See if other locations in the United States have annual temperature patterns of warmer summers and cooler winters. Do the daily temperatures over 3 year periods show variation between years?</p>

				<p>The map is centered on the Himalayas, a mountain range between India and China, which is home to the planet's highest peaks, including Mt. Everest. Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, is pinpointed. The yellow dots represent the 20 closest reporting stations to Kathmandu. Zoom in two clicks to get a closer look at where those reporting stations are located.
				<p>

			<div>
				<p>Because of the mountain range, there is a wide variation in the elevation of these reporting stations. Hover over the reporting stations to see if you can find the higest and lowest elevations.<p>

			<p>Hover over the stations labeled Tingri (northest of Kathmandu in Tibet) and Gorakhpur (southwest of Kathmandu in India). How do their elevations compare? </p>

				<p>1. Think about places where there are very high mountains. You may want to try the Rocky Mountains in the United States, the Alps in Europe, or the Andes in South America. Use the map above to zoom in on the location you would like to explore. As you move the cursor around the map, notice that the elevation appears in the menu bar just above this text below the map.</p>

			<div>
				<p>2. Click on a specific location on the map. Remember that the 20 closest reporting stations appear as yellow dots around the location you chose. You can zoom in closer on the map to get a better look at where those reporting stations are. Mouse over each of the yellow dots until you find two reporting stations that have a significant difference in elevation. (At least 1,000 feet.) Click on both reporting stations to highlight them.</p>

				<p>3. Now click on the Start calendar to choose a starting date and the End calendar to choose an ending date. Pick dates at least one year apart. If you get a graph for only one of the locations, it may be because no data was reported at that station. Just click on another dot until you get a temperature graph for two different locations.</p>

	<h2>Temperature and Large Bodies of Water</h2>
	<div class="intro-text">	
	<p>In the previous activities, you saw that the air temperature at a place is related to how far the place is from the tropical zone (its latitude) and that air temperature at a place is related to how far the place is above sea level (its elevation). The higher the latitude (farther from the tropical zone), the colder the place is, and the higher the elevation of a place, the colder the place is. This assumes, of course, that all other factors are kept constant. Obviously a place in the Rocky Mountains in the summer could be warmer than a place in New York City in the winter.</p>
	<p>
	In this activity, you are going to try to find out whether or not the air temperature at a place is related to how close the place is to a large body of water.</p>

				<p>Are air temperature and how close a place is to a body of water related?</p>

			<div>	
				<p>The map pinpoints Troms, a city in northern Norway on the Norwegian Sea.  In this activity you will explore the temperature patterns in Troms and in Kautokeino, a small town in Norway about 125 miles southeast of Troms.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
			<p>Zoom two or three clicks to get a closer look.The yellow dots represent the 20 closest reporting stations to Troms. </p>
			</div>
			<div>
			<p>Click on the reporting stations labeled Tromso and Kautokeino. Tromso is northwest of Troms and Kautokeino is southeast of Troms.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>The graph shows the average daily temperatures in Troms and in Kautokeino from December 31, 2003 to Dec. 30, 2004.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>What you see here is that in the winter and early spring Kautokeino, the place that is farther from the water, is quite a bit colder than Troms, which is close to the water, but in the summer, Troms is a little cooler than Kautokeino.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>You should also notice that the line on the graph for Troms, the place that is closer to the water, is flatter than the line for Kautokeino, the place that is farther from the water. There is a bigger range between high and low temperatures during the year in the place that is farther from the water.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>The high temperature for the year is higher and the low temperature is lower when you are farther from a large body of water.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>The reason for these patterns is that the temperature of the water has an effect on the air around it. Because water heats up and cools more slowly than land, the range in air temperature near large body of water throughout the year is smaller.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>You will now have a chance to observe the effect of proximity to a large body of water on temperature at locations of your choosing. See if other locaitons near a large body of water experience cooler summers and warmer winters compared to nearby locations farther inland.</p>

			</div>
			<div>
				<p>Also note that you may have difficulty finding reporting stations that are very close to large bodies of water because there aren’t many reporting stations right on the shoreline. You will also see that the effect of proximity to a large body of water is not always the same from place to place. Sometimes it is barely noticeable and other times it is very strong. This is because other factors, such as wind direction, can also have an effect on how much of the warmer or cooler air over the water gets inland.</p>

	<h2>Temperature</h2>
	<div class="scrollable">
	<p>You have now examined three factors that are related to the air temperature at a particular location: (1) how close a place is to the equator (latitude), (2) how far a place is above sea level (elevation), and (3) how close a place is to a large body of water.</p>
	<p>There is one other factor that has been mentioned, but it was not demonstrated in this module. That is whether or not a mass of cold or warm air has moved into a place to affect its temperature. You should know that as the wind blows, warmer or cooler air is constantly moving into and out of an area, which changes the temperature of the air at that place.</p>
	<p>To see how clouds and, therefore, air move across the United States, click on the following web links. The speed of cloud movement has been speeded up, but you can see from these videos that the air above us is always moving. Sometimes this means that warmer air is moving in from another location and sometimes colder air is moving into a region.</p>

			<div>You can see the exact  number of hours of daylight on any particular day by hovering over different  parts of the curve with the cursor. </div>
			<div>Also  notice that the line is not jagged like the line for air temperature was. The  change in the number of hours of daylight is about the same from day to day.</div>
			<div>Remember that we are talking about hours of &ldquo;daylight,&rdquo; not hours of  &ldquo;sunlight.&rdquo; Because some days are rainy or cloudy and others are clear, there  are big changes in the number of hours of sunlight each day, but the time the sun rises and sets changes very gradually from day to day.</div>
			<div>Remember that when you looked at the graph for air temperature, there was variation not only from day to day but also from year to year. Is that also true for the number of hours of daylight? What can you say about the change in hours of daylight at a place on a particular date (for example, October 1st) from one year to the next?</div>
			<div>What you should see is that the number of hours of daylight does not change from year to year. There are the same number of hours of daylight on October 1st, no matter what year it is.</div>

				<p>The place we have chosen in Columbia, South America.</p>
			</div>
			<div><p>Notice how flat  the curve is getting? In late December there is just a little less than 12  hours of daylight, and in late June, there is just a little more than 12 hours  of daylight.

			<div>Another way to describe the difference in daylight at these different places is to say that the range in daylight hours is different from place to place. The annual range of daylight hours in Columbia, which is near the equator in South America, is very small; its quite a bit larger in New York City; and larger yet in Plattsburgh, NY.

	<p>In the previous activities, you saw that the air temperature at a place is related to how far the place is from the tropical zone (its latitude) and that air temperature at a place is related to how far the place is above sea level (its elevation). The higher the latitude (farther from the tropical zone), the colder the place is, and the higher the elevation of a place, the colder the place is. This assumes, of course, that all other factors are kept constant. Obviously a place in the Rocky Mountains in the summer could be warmer than a place in New York City in the winter.</p>

You were  also able to compare those changes at different places.

		<li>Now  that you have seen how length of day, angle of the sun, and amount of solar  energy affect the temperature at a place and how all of those things change  over the course of year, we will now look at models of the earth-sun system  that will help to explain the patterns that we observe throughout the  year.   </li>

	<div class="scrollable">
	<ul>
		<li>First let&rsquo;s review some basic ideas about how  the earth and sun are related.</li>
		<li>A good way to start is by trying to make sense  of the model above.</li>
		<li>The first thing to remember is that the earth  moves around the sun. It makes one full trip around the sun in a year. It gets  a quarter of the way around in three months and half way around in six months.</li>
		<li>Another thing to keep in mind is that it stays  in the same plane as it moves around the sun, as if it were rolling along a  flat surface. It doesn&rsquo;t bounce up and down as it goes around the sun. </li>
		<li>When you look at the diagram, you can also see that  the axis of the earth (the line between the North and South Poles) is always  tilted. That tilt does not change throughout the year. This means that the  North Pole is always aimed toward the same point in space no matter where the  earth is in its path around the sun.</li>
		<li>The tilt of earth&rsquo;s axis is always 23.5o  away from the straight up and down line that you see in the diagram. If you  think of the plane of the earth&rsquo;s orbit as a table top, the straight up and  down line would be coming straight up from the top of the table. In other  words, that line would be perpendicular to the table top.</li>
		<li>The correct mathematical way to describe the  tilt of the earth is to say: The earth&rsquo;s axis of rotation is tilted 23.5o  from a line that is perpendicular to the plane of the earth&rsquo;s orbit around the  sun. Look carefully at the diagram to see if this statement makes sense to you.  First look at the plane of earth&rsquo;s orbit represented in the diagram as a dark  gray flat surface that the earth moves around the sun on. Then find the line  that is drawn perpendicular to that plane. Finally, note the way the earth is  tilted relative to that perpendicular line.</li>

		<li>As  the earth moves around the sun, different parts of the sun are pointed toward  or away from the sun at different times of the year.</li>
		<li>In  the diagram above, when it is summer in the northern hemisphere, the North Pole  is pointed toward the sun, but in the winter in the northern hemisphere, the South  Pole is pointed toward the sun.</li>
		<li>In  the spring and fall, the axis of rotation is pointed neither toward nor away  from the sun.  Whether the North or South  Pole is pointed away from the sun, toward the sun, or neither toward nor away  from the sun at different times of the year is why we have seasons.</li>

	<ul>
		<li>One more thing to keep in mind is that the earth spins  on its axis once every 24 hours.  This is  the day night cycle. </li>
		<li>In the diagram above, imagine that the sun is far to  the right. The part of the earth that is facing the sun is in daylight, and the  part of the earth that is facing away from the sun is in darkness.</li>
		<li>As the earth spins on its axis, different places move  into and out of daylight.</li>
		<li>The sun rises in the east, gets higher and higher in  the sky until it reaches its maximum height in the middle of the day, then  starts to get lower and lower in the sky until it finally sets in the west late  in the day.</li>
		<li>As the sun gets higher in the sky, the amount of  energy that a place on earth gets from the sun increases, and the temperature  rises. As the sun gets lower in the sky, the amount of energy at that place  decreases, and the  temperature drops. </li>

	<ul>
		<li>Finally,  to complete the story of the geometry of the earth-sun system, we need to pay  attention to the fact that the earth is a sphere. </li>
		<li>Because  the earth is a sphere, the light from the sun strikes the earth at different  angles at different places.</li>
		<li>Look  at the spheres below. Notice that when you shine a light on a sphere, the part  of the sphere that is closest to the light source is illuminated most brightly.  This is the place where the light strikes the sphere at a 90 degree angle.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>Notice  that there is only one place on the surface of the sphere where the sun strikes  the sphere at a 90 degree angle. At all other places, the light strikes at less  than a 90 degree angle. The farther away from the place where the light strikes  at a 90 degree angle, the smaller the angle of the light is. </li>
		<li>This  is also true on the surface of the earth. At any one time, there is only one  place where the sun strikes the earth at a 90 degree angle. The farther away  from that place a location is, the smaller the angle at which the sun strikes  the earth. At the North Pole, for example, the sun always strikes the earth at  a very low angle, and at some times of the year the sun is not visible at all.</li>

		<li>As you can see, earth-sun system is very complicated.  The earth is spinning at the same time it is orbiting around the earth, and  because the earth&rsquo;s axis is tilted, we see  the sun differently at different times of the year.</li>
		<li>To keep things simple, when we model this complex  system, we will not always show all the parts moving at the same time. This  will allow us to focus on one thing at a time.</li>
		<li>In the next set of activities, you will start out by  looking at a dynamic (moving) model of the earth-sun system with the parts in  motion, and then you will look at a number of static images of the same  system.  Altogether this should give you  a better understanding of the changes that take place throughout the year.</li>

			<div><p>Go  to the Longitude and Latitude Demonstrator to see which places around the world  are at 39o N latitude. If you start in Washington, DC and follow the  39th parallel [hover-note for &ldquo;parallel&rdquo;] eastward, you come first  to southern Europe, then China, North Korea, Japan, and finally back to the  west coast of the U.S.</p></div>
			<div><p>Remember  that all locations on the same line of latitude will experience the sun at the  same maximum height at some time during the day as the earth turns on its axis  to create the day night cycle.</p></div>
			<div><p>We&rsquo;re  going to look at four different times of the year, starting with the first day  of winter, then the first day of spring, the first day of summer, and finally  the first day of fall.</p></div>
			<div><p>We  want to see what happens to the maximum height of the sun in the sky as the  seasons change from winter to spring, to summer, and then to fall. </p></div>
			<div><p>In  the illustration above, our person is in Washington, DC, and it&rsquo;s the first day  of winter in the northern hemisphere. Notice that the North Pole is tilted away  from the sun at this time of year, and the place where the sun is directly  overhead (the yellow dot) is south of the equator, not very close to where our  person is standing.</p></div>

				<div><p><label for="models-motion9-q1">What  is the maximum height of the sun in the sky on the first day of winter in the  northern hemisphere at 39o N latitude?  First try to estimate the angle by looking at  the tilt of the arrows in the lower right hand side of the model above. If the  arrows are lying flat, the angle is zero degrees, and if arrows are pointed  straight up and down, the angle is 90 degrees.   If they are tilted but not straight up and down, then the angle is  somewhere between 0 and 90 degrees. After you have tried to estimate the angle,  go to the data tables, and enter Washington, DC as your location and December  22 as your date.</label> <input type="text" id="models-motion9-q1" name="models-motion9-q1"></p></div>
